# About this blog
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This blog is just my own notebook where I can publish some posts related to Infosec. I usually write on [Tarlogic's blog](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/), but I needed a corner where I could post articles with a "less corporative" style :).

# About the author
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My name is Juan Manuel Fern√°ndez (a.k.a. [X-C3LL](https://twitter.com/TheXC3LL)) and I love to break & fix things. I started in the security world around the year 2006, when IRC & private forums were in its death throes. Since year 2016 I am working at Tarlogic's Red Team, were we do tons of amazing things.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am a proud member of [Ka0labs](https://blog.ka0labs.net/) and I usually play CTFs with the teams [Insanity](https://ctftime.org/team/812) & [ID-10-T](https://ctftime.org/team/50611). Also in recent years I have collected some [CVEs]({{ site.baseurl}}/cves.html)

PS. As you could notice, my skills with CSS are close to NaN.
